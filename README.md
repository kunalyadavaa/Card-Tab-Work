# Card-Tab: Bookmark Card Management

Card-Tab is a bookmark card management tool that allows you to freely move bookmarks, add and delete them, categorize websites, and switch between light and dark themes.

## Updates & Features

### **2025.01.09 - New Additions**
- **bookmarks-export-addons** (located in the `bookmarks-export-addons` directory)
- **Tampermonkey script** (located in the `bookmarks export script` directory)
- Two ways to convert Chrome-exported bookmarks into JSON format and save them to KV storage

### **2024.10.30 - Updates**
- Added front-end verification and removed browser log saving. Now, you need to log in again after 15 minutes of inactivity to enhance privacy.
- Bookmarks are automatically backed up before entering settings, with the latest 10 backups saved in KV storage.
- Slight changes to the color scheme.

### **2024.10.26 - Fixes**
- Replaced the original interface for obtaining website icons:

  - **New:** `https://www.faviconextractor.com/favicon/`
  - **Backup:** `https://api.iowen.cn/favicon`
- Thanks to the authors of these interfaces for providing services.

### **2024.09.17 - Update**
- Adapted to mobile phones

### **2024.09.14 - Update**
